Gilbert Foliot (c. 1110 – 1187) was a medieval English monk and prelate, successively Abbot of Gloucester, Bishop of Hereford (Hereford Cathedral pictured) and Bishop of London. 
He became a monk at Cluny Abbey and was appointed Abbot of Gloucester in 1139. During the papal council at Reims in 1148, he was appointed Bishop of Hereford by Pope Eugene III. 
Despite promising not to recognise King Stephen, on returning to England Foliot nevertheless swore fealty to him, causing a temporary rift in his relationship with Henry of Anjou, the son of the Empress Matilda (Stephen's rival for the crown) who became King Henry II of England in 1154. 
Henry passed over Foliot for the position of Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, appointing Thomas Becket instead. 
Foliot became Bishop of London in 1163, perhaps as compensation. During the great dispute between Becket and the king, Foliot took the king's side and was reviled by Becket and his supporters. 
Becket excommunicated Foliot on two occasions, the second of which precipitated the archbishop's martyrdom. 
Foliot often served as a royal judge, and was an active administrator and bishop. 
He was also a prolific letter writer. (Full article...)
